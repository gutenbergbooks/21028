<h2>MIXED NOTIONS.</h2>

<h3>No. 1.&mdash;BI-METALLISM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Railway-carriage in a
suburban morning train to London. There are four Passengers, two of whom
are well-informed men, while the third is an inquirer, and the fourth an
average man. They travel up to London together every morning by the same
train. The two</i> Well-informed Men <i>and the</i> Average Man <i>are
City men; the</i> Inquirer <i>is a young Solicitor. They have just
finished reading their morning papers, and are now ready to impart or
receive knowledge.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> They don't seem to be making much of this Monetary
Conference in Brussels.</p>

<p><i>First Well-informed Man.</i> Of course they're not. I knew how it
would be from the start. I met <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> some
time ago, and told him what I thought about it. "You mark my words," I
said, "the whole blessed thing will be a failure. You haven't sent out
the right men, and they're certain to waste their time in useless
academic discussions." He seemed surprised, but he hadn't got a word to
say.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>deeply impressed</i>). Ah!</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> The thing's really as simple as A B C. Here are
we, a country with a gold standard, and we find that gold has
appreciated. What's the consequence? Why, silver goes down everyday, and
commerce is dislocated,&mdash;absolutely dislocated. All we have to do
is to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>breaking in</i>). One moment! When you say
gold has appreciated, you mean, of course, that the purchasing power of
gold has increased&mdash;in other words, commodities are cheaper. Isn't
that so?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Yes. Well, what then?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> What's your remedy? Do you think you can make
things better by fixing a ratio between gold and silver? In the first
place, you can't do it; they've got nothing to do with one another.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>triumphantly</i>). Haven't they? What have
you got to say, then, about the Indian rupee? That's where the whole of
your beautiful system comes to grief. You can't deny that.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> The Indian rupee has got nothing to do with
it. My theory is, that it's all due to the American coinage of silver,
and (<i>vaguely</i>), if we do the same as they, why, we shall only make
things worse. No, no, my boy, you've got hold of the wrong end of the
stick, there. Look at the Bland Bill. Do you want to have that kind of
thing in England?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> God forbid! By the way, what was the Bland Bill?</p>

<div class="floatl" style="margin:0 2% 1% 0;">

<h3>A Little Mixed.</h3>
</div>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> <i>What!</i> you don't know what the Bland
Bill was? Don't you remember it? It provided that a certain amount of
silver was to be coined every year, and the Treasury was to hold the
surplus until it reached a certain value, and then,&mdash;but every
schoolboy knows what happened.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> What did happen, as a matter of fact?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>scornfully</i>). Why, the market was
flooded.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Yes, and that exactly proves my point. Make
fifteen the ratio between gold and silver, and you'll never have the
market flooded again.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>hotly</i>). How do you make that out?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> It's as plain as a pikestaff. Make silver your
legal tender for large amounts in this country, and you stop all these
United States games at one blow.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Fiddlesticks! I suppose you'll want us to
believe next that if we become bi-metallists, corn and everything else
will go up in value?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Of course it will. We've only got to get
Germany and France, and the rest of them to come in, and the thing's as
good as done. What I say is, adopt bi-metallism, and you relieve trade
and agriculture, and everything else.</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> Do you mean we shall have to pay more for
everything?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> No, of course not; I mean that the appreciation
of gold is a calamity which we've got to get rid of.</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> I don't see it. If my sovereign buys more than it did
years ago, that seems to be a bit of a catch for me, don't it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Ah, I daresay you think so, but you're wrong.
If you fix a ratio, things may be dearer, but you'll have twice as much
purchasing power.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). How do you fix a ratio?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Ah, that's the question!</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> That's not my business. I say it ought to be
fixed, and it's for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Bank of
England to do it.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>decisively</i>). The Bank can't do it. Its
Charter won't allow it.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> How's that? I never quite understood the
Charter.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> By the Charter the Bank has
to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>But at this moment, the train having drawn up at a
station, an intruder gets into the carriage. He is severely frowned
upon, and the conversation, thus checked, is not
resumed.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>getting out at terminus, to</i> First W. I. M.).
I think I've got a pretty clear notion of Bi-metallism now, thanks to
you.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>modestly</i>). Oh, it's quite simple, if
you only take the trouble to give your mind to it.</p>

<h2>AT A VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>"The Nebuchadnezzar's
Head," in the City. Time&mdash;The luncheon hour. The interior, which is
bright, and tastefully arranged, is crowded with the graminivorous of
both sexes. Clerks of a literary turn devour "The Fortnightly" and
porridge alternately, or discuss the comparative merits of modern
writers. Lady-clerks lunch sumptuously and economically on tea and baked
ginger-pudding. Trim Waitresses move about with a sweet but slightly
mystic benignity, as conscious of conducting a dietetic mission to the
dyspeptic.</i></p>

<p><i>A Vegetarian Fianc&eacute;</i> (<i>who has met his betrothed by
appointment, and is initiating her into the mysteries</i>). I wish you'd
take something more than a mustard-and-cress roll,
though, <span class="smcap">Louise</span>&mdash;it gives you such a
poor <i>idea</i> of the thing. (<i>With honest pride.</i>) You just see
me put away this plate of porridge. At the "Young Daniel," where I
usually lunch, they give you twice the quantity of stuff they do
here.</p>

<p><i>Louise</i> (<i>admiringly</i>). I'm so glad I've seen you lunch.
Now I shall be able to fancy every day exactly what you are having.</p>

<p><i>Her Fianc&eacute;</i> (<i>to assist her imagination</i>). Mind
you, I don't <i>always</i> have porridge. Sometimes it's mushroom
croquettes, or turnip and onion rissoles,&mdash;whatever's going. Now
yesterday, for instance, I had&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He details exactly what he had, and she listens to
these moving episodes with the rapt interest of a
Desdemona.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Literary Clerk.</i> No; but look here, you don't take
my <i>point</i>. I'm not running
down <span class="smcap">Swinburne</span>&mdash;all I'm arguing is, he
couldn't have written some of the
things <span class="smcap">Browning</span> did.</p>

<p><i>Second L. C.</i> Of course
not&mdash;when <span class="smcap">Browning</span> had written
them&mdash;<i>that's</i> nothing against him.</p>

<p><i>First L. C.</i> (<i>warmly</i>). I'm not saying it <i>is</i>. I'm
telling you the difference between the two
men&mdash;now <span class="smcap">Browning</span>, he makes
you <i>think</i>!</p>

<p><i>Second L. C.</i> He never made <i>me</i> think, that's
all <i>I</i> know.</p>

<p><i>Third L. C.</i> Nor yet me. Now, <span class="smcap">'Erbert
Spencer</span>, he <i>does</i> make you think, if you like!</p>

<p><i>First L. C.</i> Now you're getting on to something else. The grand
fault I find with <span class="smcap">Swinburne</span>,
is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Second L. C.</i> Hold hard a bit. Have you read him?</p>

<p><i>Third L. C.</i> Yes, let's 'ave that first. 'Ave you <i>read</i>
'im?</p>

<p><i>First L. C.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). I've read as much of him as
I care to.</p>

<p><i>Second L. C.</i> (<i>aggressively</i>). What have you read of his?
Name it.</p>

<p><i>First L. C.</i> I've read his <i>Atlantis in Caledonia</i>, for
one thing.</p>

<p><i>Second L. C.</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). Well, you don't deny
there's poetry in <i>that</i>, do you?</p>

<p><i>First L. C.</i> I don't call it poetry in the sense I call
<span class="smcap">Walt Whitman</span> poetry&mdash;certainly not.</p>

<p><i>Second L. C.</i> There you touch a wider question&mdash;there's
no <i>rhyme</i> in <span class="smcap">Whitman</span>, to begin
with.</p>

<p><i>First L. C.</i> No more there is
in <span class="smcap">Milton</span>; but I suppose you'll
admit <i>he's</i> a poet.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>And so on, until none of them is quite sure what he
is arguing about exactly, though each feels he has got decidedly the
best of it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Lady Clerk</i> (<i>at adjoining table, to</i> Second L. C.).
How excited those young men do get, to be sure. I do like to hear them
taking up such intellectual subjects, though. Now, <i>my</i> brothers
talk of nothing but horses, and music-halls, and football, and things
like that.</p>

<p><i>Second L. C.</i> (<i>pensively</i>). I expect it's the difference
in food that accounts for it. I don't think I <i>could</i> care for a
man that ate meat. Are you going to have another muffin, dear? <i>I</i>
am.</p>

<p><i>An Elderly Lady, with short hair and spectacles (to</i> Waitress).
Can you bring me some eggs?</p>

<p><i>Waitress.</i> Certainly, Madam. How would you like them
done&mdash;<i>&agrave; la cocotte?</i></p>

<h3>"&Agrave; la Cocotte?"</h3>
</div>

<p><i>The E. L.</i> (<i>with severity</i>). Certainly <i>not</i>. You
will serve them
<i>respectably</i> dressed, <i>if</i> you please!</p>

<p><i>Waitress</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). We can give you "Convent eggs" if
you prefer it.</p>

<p><i>The E. L.</i> I never encourage superstition&mdash;poach them.</p>

<p><i>Enter a</i> Vegetarian Enthusiast, <i>with a</i> Neophyte, <i>to
whom he is playing Amphitryon</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Veg. Enth.</i> (<i>selecting a table with great care</i>).
Always like to be near the stove, and out of the draught. (<i>The
prettiest Waitress approaches, and greets him with a sacerdotal
sweetness, as one of the Faith, while to the Neophyte&mdash;whom she
detects, at a glance, as still without the pale&mdash;she is severely
tolerant.</i>) Now, what are <i>you</i> going to have? [<i>Passing him
the bill of fare.</i></p>

<p><i>The Neoph.</i> (<i>inspecting the document helplessly</i>). Well,
really, er&mdash;I think I'd better follow
<i>your</i> lead.</p>

<p><i>The Veg. Enth.</i> I generally begin with a plate of porridge
myself&mdash;clears the palate, y'know.</p>

<p><i>The Neoph.</i> (<i>unpleasantly conscious that it wouldn't clear
his</i> ). I'm afraid that, at this time of day&mdash;to tell you the
truth (<i>with desperate candour</i>), I never <i>was</i> a porridge
lover.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>The</i> Waitress <i>regards him
sorrowfully.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Veg. Enth.</i> Pity! Wholesomest thing you can take. More
sustenance to the square inch in a pint of porridge than a leg of
mutton. However (<i>tolerantly</i>), if you really won't, I can
recommend the rice and prunes.</p>

<p><i>The Neoph.</i> (<i>feebly</i>). I&mdash;I'd rather begin with
something a little more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Waitress</i> (<i>with a sad foreknowledge that she is casting

"Parsnip Pie with grilled Potatoes"&mdash;both very nice.</p>

<p><i>The Neoph.</i> (<i>braving the unknown</i>). I'll have some of
this&mdash;er&mdash;"Cinghalese Stew." [<i>He awaits the result in
trepidation.</i></p>

<p><i>Customer</i> (<i>behind, dictating his bill</i>). "What have I
had?" Let me see. Braised turnip and bread sauce, fricass&eacute;e of
carrot and artichoke, tomato omelette, a jam roll, and a bottle of
zoedone.</p>

accordingly, and awards it to him, with a bright smile of approval and
encouragement.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Enth. V.</i> (<i>who has overheard</i>). A most excellent
selection! That's a man, Sir, who knows how to <i>live</i>! Ha! here's
my porridge. Will you give me some brown sugar with it, please?
And&mdash;(<i>to the</i> N.)&mdash;there's your stew&mdash;smells good,
eh?</p>

<p><i>The Neoph.</i> (<i>tasting it, and finding it a cunning compound
of curried bananas and chicory</i>). I&mdash;I like
the <i>smell</i>&mdash;excellent indeed!</p>

<p><i>The Enth. Veg.</i> (<i>disposing of his porridge</i>). There! Now
I shall have some lentils and spinach with parsley sauce, and a Welsh
rarebit to follow&mdash;and I think that will about do me. Will
you&mdash;oh, you haven't finished your stew yet! By the way, what will
you drink? I don't often indulge in champagne in the middle of the day;
but it's my birthday&mdash;so I think we might venture on a bottle

<p><i>The Neoph.</i> (<i>in whom the Cinghalese Stew has excited a

<p><i>The Veg. Enth.</i> Only one brand&mdash;non-alcoholic, of course.

<p><i>The Neoph.</i> Exactly so. After all, I'd just as soon have

<p><i>The Neoph.</i> I&mdash;I've no doubt of it. On second thoughts, if

<p><i>The Veg. Enth.</i> (<i>more heartily than ever</i>). Just as you

mere passing fad! It's a force that's making itself increasingly

<p><i>The Neoph.</i> (<i>politely</i>). Y-yes&mdash;but it's not at all

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Baron, on behalf of small Baronites,
thanks Messrs. <span class="smcap">Cassell</span> &amp; Co. for <i>Fairy
Tales in Other Lands</i>, by <span class="smcap">Julia Goddard</span>,
as they are dear old friends with new faces.</p>

<p>One of the Assistants in the Baronial Office says, that <i>The Coming
of Father Christmas</i> is most exquisitely heralded
by <span class="smcap">E. F. Manning</span>, in the daintiest of books.
'Tis published by <span class="smcap">Frederick Warne</span> &amp; Co.
So if you warne't to make a nice present, you know where to go and get
it.</p>

<p>If <span class="smcap">Dean and Son</span> are "limited," their stock
is unlimited; and, all things considered as far as possible, the Baron's
Chief Retainer opines that the picture-books from the Deanery
of <span class="smcap">Dean and Son</span> are still the best, and, in
kind, the most varied for children. "Which nobody can Dean-y!" <i>The
Little One's Own Wonderland</i> is a delightful realm, wherein the very
little ones can wander with interest through coloured pictures and easy
fairy tales. Among the coloured picture series, the <i>Old Mother
Hubbard of</i> 1793, with its contrast, <i>Old Mother Hubbard of
To-day</i>, is very amusing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. S. Fry and Sons</span> send out
through <span class="smcap">Sell's</span> Advertising Agency samples of
their daintiest specialities in <i>bonbonni&egrave;res</i>. Being issued
by a <span class="smcap">Sell</span>, one fears a take in; but as 'tis
all good, the agency of <span class="smcap">Sell</span> secures a Sale.
The chocolates are sure to go down with everyone.</p>

<p>We all know what the sincerest form of flattery is, and certainly our
dear old pet, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, whose infinite variety time
cannot stale, will gracefully acknowledge the intenseness of the
compliments conveyed in <i>Olga's Dream</i>, as written
by <span class="smcap">Norley Chester</span>, illustrated by
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Furniss and Montagu</span> (the
illustrations will carry the book), and published by
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Skeffington</span>. It would be a
preternaturally wise child who could quite grasp some of the jokes and
up-to-date allusions. However, the real original <i>Alice</i> (<i>in
Wonderland</i>, and <i>Through the Looking-glass</i>) with the great
Master's, <span class="smcap">John Tenniel's</span>, illustrations, is
still, as <i>Mr. Sam Weller</i> said of the Governor, "paramount."</p>

<p>Light and airy are the <i>Soap Bubble Stories</i> blown
by <span class="smcap">Fanny Barry</span> through her pen-pipe. Wonder
is that, in this advertising age, she didn't dedicate them
to <span class="smcap">Pears</span>.</p>

<p>The Baron's Assistant has a word to say about the Diaries for this
next year. If you want a useful Diary, the B. A. would recommend the
"Registered Back-loop Pocket Diary," got up, like a sportsman, in the
best of leathers by <span class="smcap">John Walker</span> &amp; Co.,
or, "as Friend <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>
observes," <span class="smcap">Henry Irving</span> would say&mdash;"to
put it briefly, '<span class="smcap">Walker</span>&mdash;London.'"</p>

<p>The Baron has recently received two books, not strictly speaking
"Christmas Books," though they are, <i>et cela va sans dire</i>, books
published at Christmas-tide, the one practical and parliamentary, the
other philosophical and phenomenal; the former dedicated to the Right
Honourable <span class="smcap">Arthur Balfour</span>
by <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>, and the latter dedicated to
Lord <span class="smcap">Halifax</span>
by <span class="smcap">Lilly</span>. Two prettier names for authors, or
rather, to judge of the writers' sex by the sound of the names, for
authoresses, could not well be chosen. But authors masculine they are,
the pair of them. Mr. <span class="smcap">W. S. Lilly</span> is to be
congratulated on his very taking title, <i>The Great Enigma</i>, and all
classes of readers will be glad to be informed that it has nothing
whatever to do with the Irish Question. If any reader expects to find
the Great Enigma solved by the <span class="smcap">Lilly</span> who
toils and spins, then he must not be surprised if the author says to him
in effect, "<i>Davus sum, non &#338;dipus.</i>"</p>

<p>From <i>A Diary of the Salisbury Parliament</i>, by
Mr. <span class="smcap">H. Lucy</span>, anyone can quaff or sip, just as
his thirst for Parliamentary knowledge may be feverish or moderate, but
healthy. It is thoroughly interesting, most amusing, and really valuable
for reference withal. 'Tis written, too, in so impartial a spirit, that
it would be difficult to gather from these pages to which political
Party the Diarist belongs, but for his exuberant eulogy of the wonderful
Grand Old Man. Mr. <span class="smcap">Lucy</span> is the
Parliamentary <span class="smcap">Pepys</span>. The sketches are by an
Old Parliamentary Hand, yclept <span class="smcap">Harry Furniss</span>,
and assist the reader unfamiliar with the House of Commons to form a
pretty accurate idea of the men who are, and of the men who were, and
what they wear, and how they wear.</p>

<h3>A Reviewer.</h3>
</div>

<p>The most interesting part of <span class="smcap">James Payn's</span>
latest novel, <i>A Stumble on the Threshold</i>, to Cambridge men or
Camford men (for in this story the names are synonymous), will be the
small-beer chronicle of small College life in their University some
thirty years ago. The slang phrases of that remote period are perhaps
somewhat confused with those of a more modern time, just as an old Dutch
Master will introduce his own native town and the costume of his
fellow-countrymen into a picture representing some great Scriptural
subject, thus bringing it, so to speak, up to date, and giving us an
artistic realisation of what may be concisely termed "the historic
present." In the second volume (this novel is complete in two volumes)
the sketches of river-life, including a delightful one of the old
lock-keeper, are refreshingly breezy. The story, slight in itself, is
skilfully worked out; and the only disappointing part of it&mdash;that
is, at least to the Baron's thinking&mdash;is, that the villain of the
earlier part of the tale does not turn up again as the real culprit,
though the Baron is certain that every reader must expect him to do so,
and must feel quite sure that, in spite of the author's reticence on the
subject, it was <i>he</i> who really committed the murder, and escaped
even the author's detection, unless, out of sheer soft-heartedness
towards the puppets of his own creation, <span class="smcap">James
Payn</span> knowingly let him off at the last moment. The judicial
portion of the novel, including the scene in the Coroner's court, is
just what would have been expected from an impartial "J.P."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Degree Better.</span>&mdash;The Degree of
Doctor of Music is to be revived at Cambridge. The duties will be to

Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur Sullivan</span> is getting on.
Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> will, of course, regulate his
conduct at the tables by the prescriptions of his Medical Adviser.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Waggstaff and His Doctor.</span>&mdash;He was
ordered by his Doctor to walk two miles a day. "Can't do it in London,"
was the patient's reply; "never walk more than one mile. But," he said,
brightening up, "I'll go to Paris, as one mile there is equal to double
the distance in England. How's that? I'll tell you. I do half a mile
out, half a mile back: one mile; <i>et voil&agrave; two</i>!"</p>

of mind and body, thus not fulfilling his duties as High Sheriff, been
fined by Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Collins</span> five hundred
pounds&mdash;<i>quids pro quo</i>&mdash;unless he can show some just
cause or impediment. "He wants <span class="smcap">Tich</span>-ing up a

<h2>THE MAN WHO WOULD.</h2>

<h3>IV.&mdash;THE MAN WHO WOULD BE A CRITIC.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Barbe</span>, as a literary man and critic,
always professed a desire to live in a quiet neighbourhood. Therefore,
as I approached his house, on the almost inaccessible slopes of Campden
Hill, I was amazed to see a large and increasing crowd assembled in the
vicinity. Pushing my way through, I saw that
St. <span class="smcap">Barbe's</span> windows were broken, glass was in
a weak minority in the panes, and, what was more singular, the breakage
seemed to be done <i>from within</i>! Objects were flying out into the
garden, and those objects were books. I had the curiosity and agility to
catch a few as they fell, and to pick others up. They were mostly
volumes of Poetry, and, in every case, they bore <span class="smcap">St.
Barbe's</span> name on the fly-leaf, with a flattering manuscript
inscription by the author. Some of the authors' names were unknown to
me; in others I recognised ladies of title whom I had read about in the
Society Journals. Urging my way through a hot fire of octavos, I rang
the bell. The maid who opened the door said, "You're not an Interviewer,
Sir?"</p>

<p>"Great Heavens, no!" I replied.</p>

<p>"It is lucky for you, Sir; he's got an air-gun, and winged two
Interviewers to-day, and shot one in the hat."</p>

<p>"I am a friend of Mr. <span class="smcap">St. Barbe's</span>." I
explained, scarcely audible amidst the yells of that man of letters.</p>

<p>"He's awful bad to-day, Sir, assaulted a parcels-delivery man, who
was too heavy for him."</p>

<p>So speaking, the maid led me to <span class="smcap">St.
Barbe's</span> study. He was now quiet, and only groaning softly as he
reposed on the sofa; the fragments of furniture and the torn letters
which covered the floor, proved, however, that the crisis had been
severe, for a man who likes a quiet neighbourhood. I felt his pulse,
injected morphine, and asked him how he did?</p>

<p>"Better," said <span class="smcap">St. Barbe</span>, feebly. "I've
been clearing them out."</p>

<p>"Clearing what out?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Presentation copies of books, from the authors," he said; and added,
"and the devils of publishers."</p>

<p>At this moment the postman knocked, and the maid brought in some
letters with an air of anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Barbe</span> tore the envelopes open, "There,
and there, and there!" he cried, thrusting them into my hands, while his
features bore a satanic expression of hatred and contempt.</p>

<p>As he seemed to wish it, I read his correspondence, while he absently
twirled the poker in his hands, and gnashed his teeth.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, old man?" I asked. "These notes seem to
be very modestly and properly expressed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You will be astonished at
receiving a letter from a total stranger; but the sympathy of our
tastes, which I detect in all you write, induces me to send you my
little work on <i>The Folk Lore of Tavern Signs</i>."</p>

<p>Here <span class="smcap">St. Barbe</span> sat down on the hearth, and
scattered ashes on his head, in a manner unbecoming an Englishman.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't see what annoys you so," I remarked, "or in
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. St. Barbe</span>,&mdash;You will not
remember me, but I met you once at Lady <span class="smcap">Caerulea
Smithfield's</span>, and therefore I take the liberty of sending you my
little book of verses."</p>

<p>Here he rolled on the floor and gnawed the castor of a chair. I had
heard of things like this in the time of
the <span class="smcap">Plantagenets</span>, but I never expected to see
nowadays such ferocity of demeanour.</p>

<p>"It is signed <span class="smcap">Mary Middlesex</span>," I said.
"She's very pretty, and a Countess, or something of that sort. What's
the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Try the next," he said.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. St. Barbe</span>,&mdash;I know how busy
you are, but you can always spare an hour or two for the work of a
friend. My <i>Love well Lost</i>, in three volumes, is on its way to
you. I wish you to review it in all the periodicals with which you are
connected. Last time I wrote a novel, my nephew reviewed it, very
perfunctorily, in the <i>Pandrosium</i>; this time I want only to be
reviewed by my <i>friends</i>." He was kicking on the sofa, and
apparently trying to commit suicide with the pillows.</p>

<p>"Command yourself, <span class="smcap">St. Barbe</span>," I said;
"this behaviour is unworthy either of a Christian or a philosopher.
These letters, which irritate you so much, are conceived in a spirit of
respectful admiration. The books which you have been heaving through the
window are, no doubt, of interest and value."</p>

<p>"Waste paper, every one of them," he moaned. Then he added, as he
rumpled his hair in a frantic manner, "I'd like to see <i>you</i>, old
cock, if you had to live this life! It isn't living, it's answering
humbugging letters, and opening brown-paper parcels, all day long, all
the weary day. And my temper, which was angelic, and my manners, which
were the mirror of courtesy, are irretrievably ruined. And my time is
wasted, and my stationer's bill is mere perdition. It begins in the
morning; I try to be calm; I sit down to write replies to all these
pestilent idiots."</p>

<p>"Your admirers?" I said.</p>

<p>"They're <i>not</i> admirers; they only cadge for reviews. Time was,
they say, when critics were bribed. Ha! ha!
<i>Now</i> they all expect to be praised for nothing. And the parcels of
books they send." Here I noticed a London Parcels Delivery van, laden
with brown-paper packages of books. Quickly the maid rushed out, and
induced the driver to remember that he was a family man, and he went on
his way without calling.</p>

<p>"They come all day long," my poor friend went on, "and all of them
are trash, rubbish that they shoot here; <i>shoot</i>, ha! ha'" and he
took down a Winchester rifle, and crept stealthily to the window.
Luckily none of his enemies were in view.</p>

<p>"No waste-paper basket is big enough to hold them all," he said,
ruefully, "and once a week I make a clearance. The neighbours are
beginning to murmur," he added, "There is no sympathy, in England, for a
man of letters." Letters, indeed! I write them all day to these
impostors, these amateurs;" and he bit a large piece out of a glass,
which was standing handy.</p>

<p>"Is there no way of escaping from this persecution?" I asked, with
sympathy.</p>

<p>"None&mdash;none! I have written to the <i>Times</i>; I have applied
to the Magistrates; I have penned letters which might melt the heart of
a stone; I have even been unmannerly, I fear, now and then, for I
cannot <i>always</i> dissemble! No!" he cried, "I am doomed,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>'Presentation copies sore Long time he
bore'&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>write that on my sepulchre."</p>

<p>Here he broke down, and wept like a child. Poor fellow! he is now
under restraint, and I expect soon to hear that we have lost
<span class="smcap">St. Barbe</span>, at heart a kind, benevolent man,
but sorely treated by authors. Such are the dangers of a critical
career, and so wearing are the facilities of the Parcels Post. Others
may perish like him, men deserving of a better fate. But to appeal to
authors for mercy is vain, I know; far from sympathising with taste and
culture in distress, they actually complain that they are harshly
treated by critics. They little know what they themselves inflict.</p>

<h2>DIARY OF A STATESMAN.</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;">("<i>Made in France.</i>")</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Immense enthusiasm. The Ministry never so
strong. When asked my intentions, replied, "My intentions are the
intentions of my country." They nearly shook my hand off in their
delight. Grand official reception in the evening. Everyone there. All
the Diplomatic body offered congratulations.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Ministry suddenly threatened by an unseen
danger. Everything going smoothly, when someone in the back benches
interrogated us about an open window in the corridors. Considering the
question frivolous, declined to answer. Enormous excitement, all the
Members shaking their fists, and gesticulating. "Urgency" asked for. We
protested; and, after a heated debate, secured the passing to the Order
of the Day <i>pur et simple</i> by a majority of two! Too close to be
pleasant.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;We have been defeated! The window incident
was renewed. The Minister of Justice explained that it was the
accidental carelessness of a Commissionnaire of Police. Although the man
was brave, and crippled by a wound, the Chamber demanded his immediate
dismissal. We protested. "Urgency" was voted by a majority of 343, and
we immediately resigned. Bore to have to pack up!</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Have refused to join no less than five
combinations. Too dangerous. None of them seemed sufficiently stable.
Six men have been tried, but at present without result. Well, if nothing
is done by to-morrow morning, I shall go into the country for a little
shooting. <i>Fido</i> is quite ready&mdash;he has his coat out, his
moustache curled, and can carry a bag in his mouth. He is very good at
tricks too. Altogether a thorough sporting dogue.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Back again. Others being unable to form a
Cabinet, have formed one myself. Think it will hold together, but one
never knows. So far we have had an overwhelming vote of confidence. Put
it to the Members whether we might do what we pleased with the windows.
"Yes," and "Urgency" voted almost simultaneously. No doubt a veritable
triumph!</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Everything went smoothly until the afternoon,
when a Deputy wished to know the correct time. Minister of Education
gave it as a quarter to six. It was proved that he was wrong. He should
have said ten minutes to the hour. Serious Ministerial crisis in
consequence. Fearful excitement. A Bill brought in and passed legalising
everything that four men and a boy might decide. Ministry forced to
protest; turned out in consequence. Base ingratitude; but a time will
come! Generally hop in and out of office twice in a fortnight. Quite
accustomed to it. Good exercise.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Released from my Ministerial duties. Shall have
a day's shooting with <i>Fido</i> in consequence. But I must be back
again to-night, because I am sure to be expected to form a New Ministry
to-morrow!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Don't! You'll only think the Worse of me when

<hr class="half">

<p>"SMALL BY DEGREES, AND BEAUTIFULLY LESS."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I see that the
authorities at Monte Carlo very properly have refused permission to
Doctors, their wives and families, to visit the tables of the Casino. I
have not yet ascertained the reason for the prohibition, but no doubt it
is because the "powers that be" consider Physicians too valuable to the
community to run the risk of endangering their lives in the excitement
of play. If we may accept this as a basis, we can see how the idea can
be developed. If it is right to exclude Doctors, why then, as a kindred
class, Lawyers should also be refused admission. Of course Clergymen of
all denominations are, even now, conspicuous by their absence. If they
are not, the decree of banishment should refer also to the wearers of
the cloth.</p>

<p>We have now got rid of Doctors, Lawyers, and Parsons&mdash;three of
the Professions. To be consistent, we must take the fourth. This will
prevent Musicians from gambling. But if Musicians are tabooed, why not
Actors? And if Actors, why not Artists? And if we except Artists, we
must join Literature and Science, or there might be jealousy. And now we
have excluded Doctors, Lawyers, Parsons, Musicians, Actors, Artists,
Authors, Men of Science, and everyone more or less connected with
them.</p>

<p>Now we must remember what is bad for the master must be equally bad
for the man. So if a Doctor is excluded, a Chemist, an Undertaker, and a
Grave-digger would also be kept away. A Lawyer would carry with him
Judges, Magistrates, Clerks, and Law Stationers. The Clergy would
represent everyone connected with a church, from an Archbishop to a
Bell-ringer. Then, if we are to take away the Professions, Commerce must
follow&mdash;wholesale and retail. In one blow we keep out of the rooms
nearly the entire community.</p>

<p>Still there are the Army, the Navy, and the Civil Service. But these
are all more or less branches of the original class. They, like the
Doctors, work for the public good. Without an Army and Navy and a Civil
Service, how would the State exist? So they must go. And now we have
very little left. We have lost the Doctors, the Clergy, the Lawyers, the
Contributors to Fine Arts, the Merchants, the Traders, and the Servants
of the Crown. Naturally the lower orders would follow the lead of the
upper classes, and then there would be only the Croupiers left. And as
the Croupiers may not play themselves, and would have the play of no one
to superintend, they, too, might be excused, as their labour would be in
vain.</p>

<p>And now having reduced the visitors of the tables to an unknown
quantity, I may disappear myself. Yours retiringly,</p>

<h2>FROM PENCIL TO PEN.</h2>

<p style="text-align:center">(<i>A Story of the Merry Yule-Tide Season.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Publisher's Sanctum.</i> Publisher <i>and</i> Author
<i>discovered in conference</i>.</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> And so I thought that, perhaps, with your kind
assistance, we might work off some of the blocks that have been left on
our hands under the unfortunate circumstances I have just related.</p>

<p><i>Author.</i> Certainly. Quite easy. You want to get a Christmas
Number out of them. All right&mdash;give me the subjects, and I will
just jot down how they shall be worked in. We will commence&mdash;hero
and heroine&mdash;say, for the moment, <i>Edwin</i>
and <i>Angelina</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> (<i>looking at pictures</i>). I fancy this is intended
for somewhere in the neighbourhood of the North Pole. Sailors surrounded
by white bears on an iceberg.</p>

<h3>For Sail or Return.</h3>
</div>

<p><i>Auth.</i> Very good. <i>Edwin's</i> father was an Arctic explorer.
Write under sketch, "The old man had many a startling adventure in the
silent land of eternal snow." Go on.</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> Here is, seemingly, a quarrel to the death, in the time
of <span class="smcap">Charles the Second</span>. Ball-room, with
Cavaliers and their Ladies. Central group, a fight with swords. Can we
do anything with it?</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> Why, certainly. <i>Edwin</i> excites the jealousy
of <i>Angelina's</i> cousin <i>Reginald</i>. The latter calls out the
former at a fancy-dress dance. Label it&mdash;"<i>Captain de Courcy</i>
was too impatient to wait until the ball was over, but challenged his
rival as the company were on the eve of going down to supper." Drive
on!</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> This seems rather a puzzle,&mdash;a ship sinking in
mid-ocean.</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> The very thing. <i>Edwin</i> having lost all his money
on the Stock Exchange, goes to Australia for more gold. Label&mdash;"The
storm was terrific, and the <i>Belgravia</i> had much difficulty in
weathering this gale of almost unprecedented violence". Next,
please!</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> Why here are some sketches of Venice, St. Petersburg,
China, and North Wales.</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> I can take them <i>en bloc</i>. <i>Edwin</i> and
<i>Angelina</i>, before they return home, go upon a
honeymoon. Work them all in. Anything else?</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> A man being shot by a company of French soldiers. Is that
of any use?</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> First-rate fate for the wicked <i>Reginald</i>. Goes to
France during the Franco-German War as a Special Correspondent, and is
shot as a Prussian spy. Couldn't be better. Anything else?</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> A village crowd looking at a representation of "Punch and
Judy."</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> Obviously a recollection of <i>Edwin's</i> schooldays.
Label it&mdash;"Sometimes he would join the crowd, watching an
exhibition of perambulating puppets." Anything else?</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> A man being thrown from his horse into a brook.</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> All right! <i>Angelina</i> first falls in love
with <i>Edwin</i> when nursing him after an accident in the
hunting-field. Label it&mdash;"His horse swerved, and <i>Edwin</i> was
thrown with great violence into the water." Anything else?</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> A man with a dark lantern looking, I think, at a
mile-stone.</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> <i>Reginald</i>, before his death in France, tries to
enter burglariously the dwelling-house of his hated rival.
Label&mdash;"The misguided wretch paused for a moment while he examined
one of the mile-stones." Anything further?</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> Only two. Which shall we have, a happy or a wretched
ending?</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> Either you please. One's as easy as the other. What are
they?</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> First a man dying in the prairie is threatened by a
vulture.</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> Evidently <i>Edwin</i>. You see, we have already
disposed of the wicked cousin. What is the other?</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> Oh, the conventional thing&mdash;bridal party in a
village church. I wish we could use both.</p>

<p><i>Auth.</i> So we can. Cut down bridal block, and punch out enough
of sky in prairie to make room for it. Then give the legend,
"And <i>Edwin</i> died happily, for in his vision he saw his love once
more as he had hoped to see her. With his last breath he blessed her as
she stood beside him at the altar." That will do, and then I can finish
off with, "Who knows they may not meet again?
<span class="smcap">The End.</span>"</p>

<p><i>Pub.</i> And now I want to ask your opinion about some trade
advertisements. I want to know if we can work them in?</p>

<p>"THERE AND BACK."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span> night at Covent Garden of new
Opera, <i>Irmengarda</i>, by Chevalier, not Chevalier Coster, but
Chevalier <span class="smcap">Emil Bach</span>. In this plot the women
of a besieged city are allowed to leave it, carrying whatever is most
precious on their backs&mdash;but this
one <span class="smcap">Bach</span> can't carry <i>Irmengarda</i>, which
is, however, not too, too precious, but is supportable. Sir
<span class="smcap">Druriolanus Operaticus</span> "gives a Back,"
and it's "Over!" First Act, while performing,
is promising; second very much
after, or behind the first. House full. Everybody
good, specially <span class="smcap">Valda</span> and <span class="smcap">Abramoff</span>.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Armbruster</span> conducted the <span class="smcap">Mascagni</span>-<i>cum</i>-<span class="smcap">Wagner-&amp;-Co.</span>
music. Everybody
happy, specially <span class="smcap">Bach</span> himself, who was not
backwards in coming forwards, and bowing
his acknowledgments.</p>

<p>By the way, as in Act III. the King enters "a-riding a-riding," this
Opera may be distinguished from any of <span class="smcap">Bach's</span>
future works by being called The Horse-<span class="smcap">Bach</span>
Opera. Not to exhaust the punning possibilities in the name of the
composer, it may be incidentally noted that, original and fresh as every
air in this Opera may be, yet this present work consists entirely of
"<span class="smcap">Bach</span> Numbers." No more on this subject at
present.</p>

<p>Last week of Opera by night at Covent Garden, as the Garden is turned
into a Race-course for <i>The Prodigal Daughter's</i> steeplechase, and
Drury Lane is wanted for the Pantomime.
